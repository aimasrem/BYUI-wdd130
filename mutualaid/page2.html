                    Instead of selling" or "throwing away" what we no longer use, why not give it away.
                    More and more people want to change the way they consume. Sometimes you need something, but you can also give to someone.
                    How many items have been sitting in your closet for a long time? Instead of throwing away or letting something go to sleep that you don't need, 
                    why not give it away? Why not take a second-hand item instead of buying something you may not use much. 
                    You want to give something (material, toys, clothes, furniture, surplus vegetables from the garden etc.) propose it on our site.</p>

                <h3>LEND & BORROW</h3>
                <p> Some people buy equipment to fix something or to cook with and use it very little. 
                    Why let it gather dust when it could be useful to someone. 
                    If you just need some materials to fix your shelf but don't want to buy a drill because you know you'll only use it once, 
                    come here and see if anyone can lend you one. 
                    Your hobby is reading but you don't have a library near you, or you want to share the latest book you read because you love it.</p>
