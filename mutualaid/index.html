                <h3>Who you are?</h3>
                <p>Our purpose is to connect people who have the desire to share their skills, knowledge, goods, or time with people who need them. In a simple term we can say that the purpose is to help each other.</p>
                <p>You certainly wondering what this site can “offers” you. Let’s open the door and see what we can do for you and with you. 
                    We are not going to change the world but with you we can maybe “make it a little better or just let the sun warm our hearts", reach out and smile”
                    be the reason someone smile today. 
                    We all need someone to reach out to us at one time or another, but we too can reach out to someone in need. We want to offer a site 
                    that makes solidarity with each other accessible to everyone.
                    You want to help but you don't know how, you need help but you don't know where to ask. . Each of us has skills and knowledge to pass on. 
                    We propose different areas in which solidarity can be applied: give & receive, help & assist; lend & borrow, solidary meal.
                    With you all is possible.</p>
