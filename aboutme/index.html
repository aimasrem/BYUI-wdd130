    <p>Hello everyone, you can call me Sam. I live in France. I love dark chocolate and one of my passions is creating and immersing mysylf in book. I'd like to share with you one of my favorite quotes: "Setting goals is essentially starting with the end in mind. And planning is designing a way to get that end."(Elder Ballard).
    My hope is that each of us can find our way to complete our race with confidence even when it is difficult"</p>
